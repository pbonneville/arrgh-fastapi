# Pull Request Standards & Guidelines

*System prompt material for Claude Code and team reference documentation*

---

## üéØ Purpose

This document provides standardized guidelines for creating, reviewing, and managing pull requests. It serves as:
- **System prompt material** for AI coding assistants (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
- **Team reference documentation** for consistent PR practices
- **Automated tooling configuration** basis

---

## üìù PR Title Standards

### Conventional Commits Format (REQUIRED)
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

Examples:

fix(api): resolve null pointer error in user validation
docs: update README with deployment instructions
refactor(auth): simplify JWT token validation logic
```

### Commit Types
- **feat** - New features or functionality
- **fix** - Bug fixes
- **docs** - Documentation changes only
- **style** - Code style/formatting (no logic changes)
- **refactor** - Code restructuring (no feature/bug changes)
- **test** - Adding or modifying tests
- **build** - Build system, dependencies, CI/CD changes
- **chore** - Maintenance tasks, configuration updates
- **perf** - Performance improvements
- **ci** - Continuous integration changes

### Title Requirements
- **Length**: 50 characters max for title
- **Case**: Lowercase, no period at end
- **Mood**: Use imperative present tense ("add" not "added")
- **Clarity**: Be specific and descriptive

## üîç PR Size Guidelines

### Ideal Size Targets
- **Lines of Code**: 200-400 LOC (excluding tests, generated code)
- **Files Changed**: 5-10 files maximum
- **Scope**: Single feature, bug fix, or logical unit of work

### Large PR Guidelines
If PR exceeds ideal size:
1. **Justify in description** why it can't be split
2. **Add extra context** and documentation
3. **Include detailed testing** instructions
4. **Consider draft PR** for early feedback
5. **Break down in checklist** format for reviewers

- [ ] Tests added/updated and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] No breaking changes (or clearly documented)
- [ ] Related issues linked

## üè∑Ô∏è Labeling Strategy

### Automatic Labels (via PR title)
- `feat` ‚Üí `enhancement`
- `fix` ‚Üí `bug`
- `docs` ‚Üí `documentation`
- `test` ‚Üí `testing`
- `refactor` ‚Üí `refactoring`
- `build/ci` ‚Üí `ci-cd`

### Manual Labels
- `breaking-change` - For breaking changes
- `needs-review` - Ready for review
- `work-in-progress` - Draft/incomplete
- `security` - Security-related changes
- `performance` - Performance improvements
- `dependencies` - Dependency updates

## üîÑ PR Workflow Best Practices

### Before Creating PR
1. **Self-review** code changes thoroughly
2. **Run tests** locally and ensure they pass
3. **Update documentation** as needed
4. **Rebase/squash** commits if needed for clean history
5. **Verify branch** is up to date with target branch

### Draft PRs
Use draft PRs when:
- Work is incomplete but feedback needed
- Large changes requiring early review
- Experimental features requiring discussion
- Cross-team collaboration needed

### PR Updates
When addressing review feedback:
1. **Respond to comments** before pushing changes
2. **Group related changes** in single commits
3. **Update description** if scope changes significantly
4. **Re-request review** after major changes

---

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Integration

### For Claude Code
When creating PRs, always:
1. **Follow conventional commit format** for titles
2. **Use the template** provided above
3. **Include testing instructions** specific to the changes
4. **Link related issues** automatically when possible
5. **Add appropriate labels** based on change type

### System Prompt Instructions
```
When creating pull requests:
1. ALWAYS use conventional commit format for titles
2. ALWAYS include the required sections from PR template
3. ALWAYS provide specific testing instructions
4. ALWAYS link to related issues using "Closes #", "Fixes #", or "Relates to #"
5. ALWAYS add appropriate labels based on the type of change
6. ALWAYS ensure PR description explains the "why" not just the "what"
7. ALWAYS include breaking change documentation if applicable
```

## üîß Automation Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration
This standard supports:
- **PR title validation** (conventional commits)
- **Automatic labeling** based on title/content
- **Size validation** (warn if too large)
- **Template compliance** checking
- **Link validation** (issues, docs)

### Configuration Examples
```yaml
# .github/workflows/pr-validation.yml
name: PR Validation
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, synchronize]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Validate PR Title
        uses: amannn/action-semantic-pull-request@v5
        with:
          types: |
            feat
            fix
            docs
            style
            refactor
            test
            build
            chore
            perf
            ci
```

```

### Bad PR Title Examples
```
‚ùå Fixed bug (too vague)
‚ùå Updates (no context)
‚ùå Feature work (not descriptive)
‚ùå Various changes (multiple purposes)
‚ùå Fixed the thing that was broken (unprofessional)
```

### Good PR Description Example
```markdown
## Summary

2. Navigate to `/login` page
3. Click "Sign in with Google" button
4. Complete OAuth flow in popup window
5. Verify redirect to dashboard with user profile
6. Test logout functionality

### Test Coverage
- [x] Unit tests for OAuth service (95% coverage)
- [x] Integration tests for auth endpoints
- [x] Manual testing completed on Chrome/Firefox
- [x] Edge cases: network errors, invalid tokens

## Screenshots
[Login page screenshot]
[User dashboard screenshot]

## Additional Notes
- Requires GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_ID environment variables
